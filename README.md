# EcoScript Programming Language

EcoScript (.ecs) is a pioneering programming language designed with sustainability in mind. As AI and other computational technologies continue to grow, so does the demand for energy, particularly from GPUs. EcoScript is a step towards a future where code is not only functional but also energy-efficient. It's an initiative that aligns with the global goals of sustainable growth.

## Vision
The EcoScript project recognizes the impending challenges of energy consumption in the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence and computational technologies. This language serves as a foundational step towards understanding and optimizing the energy efficiency of code, contributing to a more sustainable future.

## Features
* Arithmetic Operations: Supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Control Flow: Includes conditional statements like if, else, and loops like while.
* Energy Consumption: Calculates the energy consumed during code execution.
* Carbon Footprint: Estimates the carbon footprint associated with running the code.


### Syntax
Variables
Declare and assign variables using the := operator:

```
x := 10;
y := 20;
```

### Arithmetic
Perform arithmetic operations:

```
z := x + y;

```

### Print Function

Print values to the console:
```
PRINT(z);
```

### Control Flow (work in progress)
Use if, else, and while statements:

```
if (z > 10) {
    PRINT(z);
} else {
    PRINT(x);
}

```


## Local Installation
* Clone the repository.
* Install the required dependencies.
* Run the interpreter with your EcoScript file.
